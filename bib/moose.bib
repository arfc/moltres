abstract = {An open source program to generate zero-thickness cohesive interface elements in existing finite element discretizations is presented. This contribution fills the gap in the literature that, to the best of the author's knowledge, there is no such program exists. The program is useful in numerical modeling of material/structure failure using cohesive interface elements. The program is able to generate one/two dimensional, linear/quadratic cohesive elements (i) at all inter-element boundaries, (ii) at material interfaces and (iii) at grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials. Algorithms and utilization of the program is discussed. Several two dimensional and three dimensional fracture mechanics problems are given including debonding process of material interfaces, multiple delamination of composite structures, crack propagation in polycrystalline structures.},

@article{dalen1979,
abstract = {This paper summarizes some research that was conducted to construct finite-element models for reservoir flow problems. The models are based on Galerkin's method, but the method is applied in an unorthodox manner to simplify calculation of coefficients and to improve stability. Specifically, techniques of compatibility relaxation, capacity lumping, and upstream mobility weighting are used, and schemes are obtained that seem to combine the simplicity and high stability of conventional finite-difference models with the generality and modeling flexibility of finite-element methods. The development of a model for single-phase gas flow and a two-phase oil/water model is described. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the usefulness of finite elements. In particular, the triangular element with linear interpolation is shown to be an attractive alternative to the standard five-point, finite-difference approximation for two-dimensional analysis.},

This is numerically cheap, physically elegant, and the fluid mass at all nodes remains non-negative.},

@article{osti_1468630,
  title = {Progress toward a new implementation of the mortar finite element method in MOOSE},
  author = {Peterson, John W.},
  abstractNote = {The mortar finite element method has been used for many years in a variety of applications, including the enforcement of continuity conditions across decomposed domains, the implementation of Dirichlet boundary conditions, obtaining improved estimates of surface fluxes, and for solving large deformation contact mechanics problems. There is a currently great deal of interest in developing more robust mechanical and thermal contact solution strategies in the MOOSE framework and physics modules, and schemes based on the mortar finite element approach appear to be a promising avenue of development. There are a number of challenges associated with the development of a robust Lagrange multiplier based formulation of the mortar finite element method which can be tackled using the relatively simple framework of thermal contact problems, before tackling more complicated applications such as thermomechanical contact. In this report, we describe several aspects of our mortar finite element method implementation for solving thermal contact problems. The approach and notation used are based primarily based on the work of Bin Yang et al. ("Two dimensional mortar contact methods for large deformation frictional sliding," International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 62(9), 2005).},
