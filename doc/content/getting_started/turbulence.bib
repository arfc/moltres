	abstract = {Measurements, principally with a hot-wire anemometer, were made in fully developed turbulent flow in a 10-inch pipe at speeds of approximately 10 and 100 feet per second. Emphasis was placed on turbulence and conditions near the wall. The results include relevant mean and statistical quantities, such as Reynolds stresses, triple correlations, turbulent dissipation, and energy spectra. It is shown that rates of turbulent-energy production, dissipation, and diffusion have sharp maximums near the edge of the laminar sublayer and that there exist a strong movement of kinetic energy away from this point and an equally strong movement of pressure energy toward it.},

	abstract = {The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework is a high-performance, open source, C++ finite element toolkit developed at Idaho National Laboratory. MOOSE was created with the aim of assisting domain scientists and engineers in creating customizable, high-quality tools for multiphysics simulations. While the core MOOSE framework itself does not contain code for simulating any particular physical application, it is distributed with a number of physics "modules" which are tailored to solving e.g. heat conduction, phase field, and solid/fluid mechanics problems. In this report, we describe the basic equations, finite element formulations, software implementation, and regression/verification tests currently available in MOOSE's navier\_stokes module for solving the Incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations.},
