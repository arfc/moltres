Moltres is a finite element-based multiphysics reactor simulation tool for molten salt reactors
(MSRs) and other advanced reactors in various dimensions and geometries. Moltres is built on the
MOOSE framework and provides multiphysics
capabilities to accurately model delayed neutron precursor drift and the strong temperature
feedback effects inherent in MSRs. Users have the flexibility of setting up fully coupled solves
in which all variables are solved in a single monolithic system or tightly coupled solves by
arbitrarily segregating systems of equations corresponding to separate physics. As a MOOSE-based
application, Moltres can also scale efficiently on high-performance computers.
