Moltres is a finite element-based multiphysics reactor simulation tool for molten salt reactors
(MSRs) and other advanced reactors in various dimensions and geometries. Moltres is built on the
MOOSE framework and provides multiphysics
capabilities to accurately model delayed neutron precursor drift and the strong temperature
feedback effects inherent in MSRs. Users have the flexibility of setting up fully coupled
solution schemes in which all variables are solved in a single monolithic system, or tightly
coupled solution schemes by arbitrarily segregating systems of equations corresponding to separate
physics. As a MOOSE-based application, Moltres can also scale efficiently on high-performance
computers.
