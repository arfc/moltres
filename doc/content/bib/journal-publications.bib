	abstract = {Moltres is a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fueled molten salt reactors
(MSRs) (Lindsay et al. 2018). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and precursor
transport equations are set-up using an action system that allows the user to use an arbitrary
number of neutron energy and precursor groups respectively with minimal input
changes. Moltres sits on top of the Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(Gaston et al. 2015) and hence uses the finite element method to discretize the
governing partial differential equations. In general the resulting system of non-linear algebraic
equations is linearized using the Newton-Raphson method and then solved using
the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (Balay et al. 2017). Assembly
of the Jacobian and residual, and the linear solve are parallelized using MPI which
allows Moltres to be run in massively parallel environments. Runs on the Blue Waters
supercomputer at Illinois have utilized up to 608 cores.
Moltres and MOOSE allow use of different basis functions for different system variables.
Because of the purely diffusive nature of the neutron diffusion equations, neutron fluxes are
typically discretized using continuous first-degree Lagrange polynomials and the degrees of
freedom are associated with mesh nodes. The temperature variable may also be discretized
with a continuous Lagrange basis, or a discontinuous basis of arbitrary degree monomials
may be employed depending on the relative balance of heat convection to conduction. The
purely hyperbolic precursor transport is currently discretized using constant monomials,
which is equivalent to a first-order finite volume discretization. Moltres supports both
segregated (through Picard iteration) and monolithic solutions of the equation system.
However, due to the feedback between the power spectrum and temperature dependence
of macroscopic cross-sections, monolithic solves have demonstrated superior robustness
with segregated techniques often unable to converge to a solution. This result emphasizes
the importance of a fully coupled multi-physics framework like the one that Moltres and
MOOSE provide and suggests that iteratively coupling codes devoted to single physics
(Kópházi, Lathouwers, and Kloosterman 2009) may result in limited flexibility.},

	abstract = {Modeling strongly coupled neutronics and thermal–hydraulics in liquid-fueled MSRs requires robust and ﬂexible multiphysics software for accurate simulations at reasonable computational costs. In this paper, we present Moltres and its neutronics and thermal–hydraulics modeling capabilities relevant to multiphysics reactor analysis. As a MOOSE-based application, Moltres provides various multiphysics coupling schemes and time-stepping methods, including fully coupled solves with implicit time-stepping. We veriﬁed Moltres’ MSR modeling capabilities against a multiphysics numerical benchmark developed for software dedicated to modeling fast-spectrum MSRs. The results show that Moltres performed comparably to participating software packages in the benchmark; the majority of the relevant quantities fell within one standard deviation of the benchmark average. Among the participating multiphysics tools in the benchmark, Moltres agrees closest to the multiphysics tool from the Delft University of Technology due to similarities in the numerical solution techniques and meshing schemes.},
